The continentalness values and shaper values MUST BE ASCENDING!

If you modify these continentalness values, please remember to modify shaper values under the guide.

For example, default values are:

```json
{
	"MUSHROOM_FIELDS_TO_DEEP_OCEAN_CONTINENTALNESS": -1.01,
	"DEEP_OCEAN_TO_OCEAN_CONTINENTALNESS": 0.34,
	"OCEAN_TO_COAST_CONTINENTALNESS": 0.42,
	"COAST_TO_INLAND_CONTINENTALNESS": 0.51,
	"NEAR_INLAND_TO_MID_INLAND_CONTINENTALNESS": 0.62,
	"MID_INLAND_TO_MOUNTAINS_CONTINENTALNESS": 0.785,
	"PEAKS_CONTINENTALNESS": 0.9,

	"MUSHROOM_FIELDS_TO_DEEP_OCEAN_SHAPER": -0.99,
	"DEEP_OCEAN_TO_OCEAN_SHAPER": 0.31,
	"OCEAN_TO_COAST_SHAPER": 0.395,
	"COAST_WATER_SHAPER": 0.43,
	"COAST_BANK_SHAPER": 0.47,
	"COAST_LAND_SHAPER": 0.48,
	"NEAR_INLAND_SHAPER": 0.52,
	"INLAND_EROSION_SHAPER": 0.64,
	"MID_INLAND_SHAPER": 0.76,
	"PEAKS_EROSION_SHAPER": 0.92,

	"OCTAVE_CONTINENTALNESS_ADDER": 1
}
```

Notice that the larger gap between two neighbor values, the more frequently it will generate. The example given above means deep ocean (-1.01~0.34) will generate most frequently.

You can also try the value Vanilla uses:

```json
{
	"MUSHROOM_FIELDS_TO_DEEP_OCEAN_CONTINENTALNESS": -1.05,
	"DEEP_OCEAN_TO_OCEAN_CONTINENTALNESS": -0.455,
	"OCEAN_TO_COAST_CONTINENTALNESS": -0.19,
	"COAST_TO_INLAND_CONTINENTALNESS": -0.11,
	"NEAR_INLAND_TO_MID_INLAND_CONTINENTALNESS": 0.03,
	"MID_INLAND_TO_MOUNTAINS_CONTINENTALNESS": 0.3,
	"PEAKS_CONTINENTALNESS": 0.55,

	"MUSHROOM_FIELDS_TO_DEEP_OCEAN_SHAPER": -1.02,
	"DEEP_OCEAN_TO_OCEAN_SHAPER": -0.51,
	"OCEAN_TO_COAST_SHAPER": -0.44,
	"COAST_WATER_SHAPER": -0.18,
	"COAST_BANK_SHAPER": -0.16,
	"COAST_LAND_SHAPER": -0.15,
	"NEAR_INLAND_SHAPER": -0.1,
	"INLAND_EROSION_SHAPER": 0.06,
	"MID_INLAND_SHAPER": 0.25,
	"PEAKS_EROSION_SHAPER": 0.65,
	"OCTAVE_CONTINENTALNESS_ADDER": 0
}
```

And here are some constructive comments for you to modify the shaper values:

- MUSHROOM_FIELDS_TO_DEEP_OCEAN_SHAPER should be greater than MUSHROOM_FIELDS_TO_DEEP_OCEAN_CONTINENTALNESS.
- DEEP_OCEAN_TO_OCEAN_SHAPER should be a little less than DEEP_OCEAN_TO_OCEAN_CONTINENTALNESS.
- OCEAN_TO_COAST_SHAPER should be between DEEP_OCEAN_TO_OCEAN_CONTINENTALNESS and OCEAN_TO_COAST_CONTINENTALNESS.
- COAST_WATER_SHAPER should be close to OCEAN_TO_COAST_CONTINENTALNESS.
- COAST_BANK_SHAPER should be between OCEAN_TO_COAST_CONTINENTALNESS and COAST_TO_INLAND_CONTINENTALNESS.
- COAST_LAND_SHAPER should be a little greater than COAST_BANK_SHAPER.
- NEAR_INLAND_SHAPER should be a little greater than COAST_TO_INLAND_CONTINENTALNESS.
- INLAND_EROSION_SHAPER should be a little greater than NEAR_INLAND_TO_MID_INLAND_CONTINENTALNESS.
- MID_INLAND_SHAPER should be a little less than MID_INLAND_TO_MOUNTAINS_CONTINENTALNESS.
- PEAKS_EROSION_SHAPER should be a little greater than PEAKS_CONTINENTALNESS.
